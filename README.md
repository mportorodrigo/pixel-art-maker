# Pixel Art Maker Project
This pixel art maker was made as a [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)'s [Intro to Programming Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000) project, in which, with the provided HTML and CSS I had to write the desings.js so that the user could create a canvas of any (reasonable) size, color the "pixels" in the grid and reset it to a blank state.
Original files can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter).
